- save (local - this is normal computer stuff)
- stage (local changes "ready to commit")
- commit (local - making a change, somewhat harder to undo, not impossible)
- push (remote - "syncing" your local changes to Github)
- (you can also pull, have branches, merge, on and on... but don't worry about that)
